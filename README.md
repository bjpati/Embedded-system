# Embedded-system
Basic course in embedded systems and programming STM32Cubeide in C-Language.  

### Intended learning outcomes
The student will get knowledge about important concepts and knowledge and skills about methods in this area and be able to limit requirements to specify an embedded system.

This means that the student after passing the course will for an embedded system be able to:

* Read requirements and write a specification
* Design architecture of both hardware and software
* Describe the microcontroller used in the system
* Describe the use of I/O ports for external signals and comminication with circuits
* Compare and analyse different ways to handle real time problems
* Realise the software for a given problem
* Rive examples of soft- and hard real time problems
* Rescribe usual methods for scheduling tasks and describe how to communicate between tasks
* Use a real time operativ system to implement a program in a time critical system
* Plan, design and implement a strategy for testing
* Write a technical report describing the system.

### Course contents
* Labs to be familiar with software and hardware.
* Computer based tools is used in the course.
* Examples of processor types and operating systems.
* Examples of interface and communication.
* Programming tools, programming language and programming.
* System tools and system design.
* Consequencies of real time problems.

### Course Design
There are two seminars with mandatory attendance.

The laboratory and project part of this course consist of three parts: 
* Introductory PingPong Lab
* Real-Time Operating System Lab
* Project
